My solution for the problem involves designing a 2d array, and iterrating though said grid. Using Tabulation, I run through a double for loop over the grid and compare the value of the current index, to the indexes of the previuos lines. Which ever index I am on, is escentially the same as the one above it, with the extra y-level. So I compare the value to the ones before it in order to save on calculations, rather than recompute all calculations for every square. To store the data, I fill each index with a data class, holding the value of the square, as well as the "food" thats in it. When we have room for the food in the square, we add it to the classes items list. If the current item would fit inside the square but only if we replace an item, we compare the curren square to a square without. To get the data into my function, I split up the initial input and give the function all of the values independantly, as in the cap and total items are given directly, while the names, values, and weights are given as their own lists.
This gives us the pseudo polyomial intended time.
By using dynamic programing for this problem, we are able to use this time, as we take w steps for n number of input, which is O(NW) time
