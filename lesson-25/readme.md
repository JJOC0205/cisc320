For this assignment, I used a program following the nearest neigbor method. I first initalize a list and fill it with n False values, where n is the length of the input. I set the first value in it to True to signify the first node in the path. From there, I interate through a double for loop, where i check every element of every sublist and see if I have not visited that index and that the value is less than the "shortest" path from that node. This gives me the node with the shortest path to the next nearest node. From there, I set it to the new shortest and that node as the "next" one to visit. From there, I add the distance to the total distance, set that node as visited, and repeat until I've visited all nodes. Then, I add the distance from that last node to the first node tot he total, as well as append it to my path list. I return both the distance and path as a touple. All of this is done n times as I repeat the entire process again and again with each potential starting node, and append all of the return values into a list. I then call the min function to find the smallest distacne, and output that path and distance.
