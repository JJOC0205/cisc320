1: My solution for this question was to create some variables, represetnging the eventual total sum, the number of lines to be read, initialized as the first value in my array of lines, as well as a boolean flag to see if something has been added. From here I first check if the nnumber of lines to be read is 0, as if it is we can immediatly return "EMPTY". Next, wed then iterate through the list, starting from element 1 and going up however many we are supposed to read. Now if the value read is -999, it will immediately return the total value if there has been a validAddition. If there has not been such addition, it will return empty. If the value is a non-negative number it will add it to the total and then change valid addition to true. This means that it will return a number rather than an EMPTY. From here it will check if a valid addition was made and return the number, and return EMPTY if one was not made

2: The runtime for this should be O(n), as it must iterate through the entire array in order to get an answer. While sometimes it wont go through the full array, we drop all constants for runtimes so it would simplify to O(n)
